# PD-Demo-Synth
A project detailing understanding of base level plugin development. The demo is a wavetable synth with an ADSR, Filter, QWERTY Keyboard, Waveshaper and Oscilloscope. 

This patch can be demo'd via PD's editor but currently does not have a downloadable version.

# Preface
While the raw code can be interpretted as such, pure data AKA PD is a visual coding language derived from C++ used for patch and plugin development. Each block acts as a method that allows for both digital and analog signal processing.
